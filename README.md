# 📊 Project: Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## 🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build a supervised machine learning model capable of predicting, based on customer behavior, whether a client will cancel their contract with the bank (churn). The model returns `1` for customers who are likely to churn and `0` for those who are likely to stay.
